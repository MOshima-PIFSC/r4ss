**r4ss** is a package of tools related to the Stock Synthesis fisheries stock
assessment modeling framework. This first Vignette covers installing the
package and some basic uses.

## Installing the r4ss R package

### Basic installation
The package can be run on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
The CRAN version of r4ss is not regularly updated and therefore likely out of
date. Instead it is recommended to install the from GitHub with the following
code which depends on the `devtools` package 
(which in turn depends on a variety of additional packages):

```{r, install-and-load, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # if needed
devtools::install_github("r4ss/r4ss")

# If you would like the vignettes (so far there's just this one):
devtools::install_github("r4ss/r4ss", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Loading the package and reading help pages
You can then load the package with:

```{r, load-package, eval=FALSE}
library("r4ss")
```

You can read the help files and access this vignette (and any others created
in the future) with:

```{r, help, eval=FALSE}
?r4ss
help(package = "r4ss")
browseVignettes("r4ss")
```


Although we've made an effort to maintain backward compatibility to at least 3.24S (from July, 2013), there 
may be cases where it's necessary to install either an older version of r4ss, such as when a recent change 
to the package causes something to fail, or a development version of the package that isn't in the `master`
repository yet, such as to test upcoming features.

### Alternative versions

To install alternative versions of r4ss, provide a reference to the `install_github`, such as 
```{r, install-older-version, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r4ss/r4ss", ref="1.26.0") # install r4ss version 1.26.0

```
where the `ref` input can be a release number, the name of a branch on GitHub, or a git SHA-1 code, which are listed with all code changes that are committed to the git repository: https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/commits/ and can also be found (starting with r4ss version 1.29.0, on the "Home" tab of the HTML view of the plots created by `SS_plots` as described below).


## Reading model output and making default plots {#plot}


The most important two functions are `SS_output` and `SS_plots`, the first
for reading the output from a Stock Synthesis model and the second for making
a large set of plots illustrating that output.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# it's useful to create a variable for the directory with the model output
mydir <- file.path(path.package("r4ss"), "extdata/simple_3.30.12")

# read the model output and print some diagnostic messages 
replist <- SS_output(dir = mydir, verbose=TRUE, printstats=TRUE)

# plots the results
SS_plots(replist)
```

By default `SS_plots` creates a large collection of PNG files in a new `plots` sub-directory in the same location as your model files, along with a set of HTML files (example excerpt below) to facilitate exploration of the figures in your browser. The home tab should open in your browser automatically after `SS_plots` completes making all the files.

### Creating only necessary plots

`SS_plots` often takes a while to run because of the number of plots created. If only a few plots are of interest, it is more efficient to plot only the necessary ones. Groups of plots to generate in the call to `SS_plots` can be done by changing the `plot` argument. For example, if only the plots of Catch were desired:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SS_plots(replist = replist, plot = 7)
```

If only plots of catch and discards were desired, the user could call:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
SS_plots(replist = replist, plot = c(7,9))
```
The documentation for the plot argument in the help file for SS_plots lists the corresponding numbers for each group of plots.

It is not uncommon to occasionally run into bugs with the plotting functions because of the vast number of model configurations available in SS and plots created from them. A strategy with for dealing with a bug is to exclude the set of plots where the bug is occurring as a temporary fix (bugs typically get attention fairly quickly from maintainers when reported to the [r4ss issue tracker](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues). For example, if there was a bug in the conditional age-at-length fits (plot set 18), exclude the plot:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SS_plots(replist, plot = c(1:17, 19:26))
```

## Scripting Stock Synthesis workflows with r4ss

Using functions in `r4ss`, a fully scripted workflow for modifying Stock Synthesis files and running Stock Synthesis models is possible.

We'll demonstrate this by creating a new model from a model in the `r4ss` package.

```{r}
# initial model to modify
mod_path <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "simple_3.30.13"), package = "r4ss")
# create a new directory to put a new, modified version of the model
new_mod_path <- "simple_new"
```
Use the r4ss utility function to copy over the model files from `mod_path` to `new_mod_path`:

```{r}
copy_SS_inputs(dir.old = mod_path, dir.new = new_mod_path)
```

Note that the function `copy_multiple_folders()` can be used to copy several folders of Stock Synthesis model inputs.

### Read in Stock Synthesis files

Stock Synthesis files can be read in as list objects in R using the `SS_read*` functions.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
start <- r4ss::SS_readstarter(file = file.path(new_mod_path, "starter.ss"), 
                              verbose = FALSE)
# note the data and control file names can vary, so are determined from the 
# starter file.
dat <- r4ss::SS_readdat(file = file.path(new_mod_path, start$datfile),
                        verbose = FALSE)
# Read in ctl file. Note that the data fileR object is needed so that SS_readctl
# assumes the correct data structure
ctl <- r4ss::SS_readctl(file = file.path(new_mod_path, start$ctlfil),
                        verbose = FALSE,
                        use_datlist = TRUE, datlist = dat)
fore <- r4ss::SS_readforecast(file = file.path(new_mod_path, "forecast.ss"),
                              verbose = FALSE)
# can also read in wtatage.ss for an empirical wt at age model using
# r4ss::SS_readwtatage()
```

### Investigate the model

Each of the input files is read into R as a list. The components of the list should be in the same order as they appear in the text file. Use `names` to see all the list components

```{r}
names(start) # see names of the list components of starter
```
Or reference a specific element to see the components. For example, we can look at the mortality and growth parameter section (MG_parms)

```{r}
ctl$MG_parms
```

### Modify the model
You could make basic or large structural changes to your model in R. For example, the initial value of M can be changed:

```{r}
# view the initial value
ctl$MG_parms["NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", "INIT"]
#change it to 0.2
ctl$MG_parms["NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", "INIT"] <- 0.2
```

Settings in other files can also be modified. For example, the biomass target can be modified in the forecast file
```{r}
fore$Btarget
fore$Btarget <- 0.45
fore$Btarget
```

### Write out the modified models

The `SS_write*` functions can be used to write out the modified stock synthesis input R objects into input files:

```{r}
r4ss::SS_writestarter(start, dir = new_mod_path, overwrite = TRUE, 
                      verbose = FALSE)
r4ss::SS_writedat(dat, outfile = file.path(new_mod_path, start$datfile), 
                  overwrite = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
r4ss::SS_writectl(ctl, outfile = file.path(new_mod_path, start$ctlfile),
                  overwrite = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
r4ss::SS_writeforecast(fore, dir = new_mod_path, file = "forecast.ss", 
                       overwrite = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

If you make changes to the input model files that render the file unparsable by Stock Synthesis, the `SS_write*` functions may throw an error (and hopefully provide an informative message about why). However, it is possible that an invalid Stock Synthesis model file could be written, so the true test is whether or not it is possible to run Stock Synthesis with the modified model files.

If you need help troubleshooting SS_read* or SS_write* functions or would like to report a bug, please [post an issue in the r4ss repository.](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues)

### Run the modified model

The model can now be run with Stock Synthesis. The call to do this depends on where the Stock Synthesis executable is on your computer. If the Stock Synthesis executable is in the same folder as the model that will be run, `run_SS_models` can be used. Assuming the stock synthesis executable is called ss.exe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
r4ss::run_SS_models(dirvec = new_mod_path, model = "ss", 
                    skipfinished = FALSE)
```

Note this is similar to resetting the working directory and running the model with `system()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wd <- getwd()
setwd(new_mod_path)
system("./ss")
setwd(wd)
```

The advantage of `run_SS_models` is that there is no need to change the wd.

If you have an executable in a different folder, there is not an option to do this from `run_SS_models` currently. However, a basic function can be used to allow the stock synthesis folder to exist anywhere.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' Function to run ss from a specified path. Less bells and whistles than
#' run_SS_models
#' @param new_mod_path The path to the model to run
#' @param path_to_exe The path to the executable, either absolute or relative 
#'  to new_mod_path
#' @param options To add command line options, like "-nohess" or 
#'  "-stopph 0 -nohess"
run_ss <- function(new_mod_path, path_to_exe, options = "") {
  wd <- getwd()
  on.exit(setwd(wd)) # to ensure the wd is changed back even if fxn errors.
  setwd(new_mod_path)
  system(paste(path_to_exe, options))
}
# .. means 1 folder back from the the model folder(s). This could also be an
# absolute rather than a relative path.
run_ss(new_mod_path = new_mod_path, path_to_exe = "../ss")
```

Finally, if the stock synthesis executable is in your PATH, then the the `run_SS_models` can be called with `exe_in_path = TRUE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
r4ss::run_SS_models(dirvec = new_mod_path, model = "ss", exe_in_path = TRUE,
                    skipfinished = FALSE)
```

### Running models in multiple directories

A vector of directories can also be passed to the `dirvec` variable in `run_SS_models` to run models in multiple directories with one function call.

### Investigate the model run

As [previously](#plot), `SS_output` and `SS_plots` can be used to investigate the model results.

### Should I script my whole Stock Synthesis workflow?

Scripting using r4ss functions is one way of developing a reproducible and coherent Stock Synthesis development workflow. However, there are many ways that Stock Synthesis models could be run and modified. What is most important is that you find a workflow that works for you and that you are able to document changes being made to a model. Using version control (such as git) is another tool that may help you document changes to models.

## Functions for common stock assessment tasks

While stock assessment processes differ among regions, some modeling workflows and diagnostics are common. Within r4ss, there are functions to perform a retrospective (`SS_doRetro()`), jitter the starting values and reoptimize the stock assessment model a number of times to check for local minima (`SS_run_jitter()`) and tuning composition data (`SS_tune_comps()`).

Additional model diagnostics for Stock Synthesis models are available as part of the [ss3diags](https://github.com/jabbamodel/ss3diags) package.

### Running retrospectives

A retrospective analysis removes a certain number of years of the model data and recalculates the fit. This is typically done several times and the results are used to look for retrospective patterns (i.e., non-random deviations in estimated parameters or derived quantities as years of data are removed). If the model results change drastically and non-randomly as data is removed, this is less support for the model. For more on the theory and details behind retrospective analyses, see [Hurtado-Ferro et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsu198) and [Legault 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa184).

The function `SS_doRetro()` can be used to run retrospective analyses starting from an existing Stock Synthesis model. Note that it is safest to create a copy of your original Stock Synthesis model that the retrospective is run on, just in case there are problems with the run. For example, a five year retrospective could be done:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
retro_dir <-"retro_dir"
copy_SS_inputs(dir.old = mod_path, dir.new = retro_dir) # copy over the stock synthesis model

## retrospective analyses
SS_doRetro(masterdir = retro_dir, oldsubdir = "", newsubdir = "retrospectives", 
           years = 0:-5)
```
After running this retrospective, six new folders would be created within `retro_dir`, where each folder would contain a different run of the retrospective (removing 0 to 5 years of data).

After the retrospective models have run, the results can be used as a diagnostic:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
retroModels <- SSgetoutput(dirvec = file.path(retro_dir, "retrospectives", 
                                              paste("retro", 0:-5, sep = "")))
retroSummary <- SSsummarize(retroModels)
endyrvec <- retroSummary[["endyrs"]] + 0:-5
SSplotComparisons(retroSummary, endyrvec = endyrvec,
                  legendlabels = paste("Data", 0:-5, "years"))
# calculate Mohn's rho, a diagnostic value
rho_output <- SSmohnsrho(summaryoutput = retroSummary, endyrvec = endyrvec,
                         startyr = retroSummary[["endyrs"]]-5 , verbose = FALSE)
```

### Jittering

Another commonly used diagnostic with Stock Synthesis models is "jittering". Model initial values are changed randomly (by some fraction) and the model is reoptimized. The `SS_RunJitter()` function performs this routine for the number of times specified by the user. For a stock Synthesis model in a folder called `my_model` that also contains a copy of the stock synthesis executable named ss (or ss.exe on Windows), jittering starting values can be run 100 times (note this could take a while, as this is running the model 100 times):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
jitter_dir <-"retro_dir"
copy_SS_inputs(dir.old = mod_path, dir.new = jitter_dir) # copy over the stock synthesis model
# Note: would also need to add the stock synthesis executable to the jitter_dir
# folder
jitter_loglike <- SS_RunJitter(
  mydir = jitter_dir,
  model = "ss", # name of the stock synthesis exe in jitter_dir
  Njitter = 100,
  verbose = FALSE,
  jitter_fraction = 0.1 # a typically used jitter fraction
             )
```
The output from `SS_RunJitter()` is saved in `jitter_loglike`, which is a table of the different negative log likelihoods produced from jittering. If there are any negative log likelihoods smaller than the original model's log likelihood, this indicates that the original model's log likelihood is a local minimum and not the global minimum. On the other hand, if there are no log likelihoods lower than the original model's log likelihood, then this is evidence (but not proof) that the original model's negative log likelihood could be the global minimum.

Jittering starting values can also provide evidence about the sensitivity of the model to starting values. If many different likelihood values are arrived at during the jitter analysis, then the model is sensitive to starting values. However, if many of the models converge to the same negative log likelihood value, this indicates the model is less sensitive to starting values.

### Tuning composition data

Three different routines are available to tune (or weight) composition data in Stock Synthesis. The McAllister-Ianelli (MI) and Francis tuning methods are iterative reweighting routines, while the Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) option incorporates weighting parameters directly in the original model.

Because tuning is commonly used with Stock Synthesis models, and users may be interested in exploring the same model, but  using different tuning methods, `SS_tune_comps()` can start from the same model and transform it into different tuning methods.

As an example, we will illustrate how to run Francis tuning on an example Stock Synthesis model built into the r4ss package. First, we make a copy of the model to avoid changing the original model files 
```{r}
mod_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "simple_mod")
# Path to simple model in r4ss and copy files to mod_path
example_path <- system.file("extdata", "simple_3.30.13", package = "r4ss")
# copy model input files
copy_SS_inputs(dir.old = example_path, dir.new = mod_path, verbose = FALSE)
# copy over the Report file to provide information about the last run of this model
file.copy(
  from = file.path(example_path, "Report.sso"),
  to = file.path(mod_path, "Report.sso")
)
# copy comp report file  to provide information about the last run of this model
file.copy(
from = file.path(example_path, "CompReport.sso"),
to = file.path(mod_path, "CompReport.sso")
)
```

 The following call to `SS_tune_comps()` runs MI weighting for 1 iteration and allows upweighting. Assume that an ss executable called "ss or ss.exe" is available in the mod_path folder.
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tune_info <- SS_tune_comps(
  option = "MI",
  niters_tuning = 1,
  dir = mod_path,
  allow_up_tuning = TRUE,
  model = "ss",
  verbose = FALSE
)
# see the tuning table, and the weights applied to the model.
tune_info
```

Now, suppose we wanted to run the same model, but using Dirichlet-multinomial parameters to weight. The model can be copied over to a new folder, then the `SS_tune_comps` function could be used to add Dirichlet-multinomial parameters (1 for each fleet with composition data and for each type of composition data) and re run the model.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mod_path_dm <- file.path(tempdir(), "simple_mod_dm")
copy_SS_inputs(dir.old = mod_path, dir.new = mod_path_dm, verbose = FALSE,
               copy_exe = TRUE)
# copy over the Report file to provide information about the last run of this model
file.copy(
  from = file.path(mod_path, "Report.sso"),
  to = file.path(mod_path_dm, "Report.sso")
)
# copy comp report file  to provide information about the last run of this model
file.copy(
from = file.path(mod_path, "CompReport.sso"),
to = file.path(mod_path_dm, "CompReport.sso")
)
# Add Dirichlet-multinomial parameters and rerun. The function will 
# automatically remove the MI weighting and add in the DM parameters.
# Use extras = "-nohess" when running model to speed up run.
DM_parm_info <- SS_tune_comps(
  option = "DM",
  niters_tuning = 1, # must be 1 or greater to run, through DM is not an iterative reweighting approach
  dir = mod_path_dm,
  model = "ss",
  extras = "-nohess",
  verbose = FALSE
)
# see the DM parameter estimates
DM_parm_info[["tuning_table_list"]]
```

There are many options in the `SS_tune_comps` function; please see the documentation (`?SS_tune_comps` in the R console) for more details and examples.
